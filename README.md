# ILN_Test
The test is to create a "Quiz" component. Similar to Quizlet. It allows for a user to test themselves like they would with flashcards. A card has a "question" and an "answer" that initially shows the question and when the card is clicked the answer is shown. upon clicking again it shows the question again and so on.

The user should be able to create new cards.

The user should be able to delete cards.

The user should be able to cycle through the cards they currently have ("left" and "right" a "random card" button would be a nice addition)

The user should be able to edit a card.

a display card to show the current flashcard that I am on that allows for editing and deleting the current card (but not the display obviously)

The user should be able to see all of their cards. (preferably by a toggle button to "see all" and see the one. This should not hide the display card.

For the sake of the test it should be mostly functional but still presentable (so some decent css)


These tasks are listed in order of importance start from the top and work your way down but don't refrain from another part if you are stuck in one part, it just may be hard to move forward without a previous step.

This would require a preset data to load and render the cards and the save should save the data in that same kind of format (so its ready to be loaded) you can simply hard code in the initial data.

Please include the javascript css and html as one file so all that I would have to do to test the code is open the html file and test the component.
